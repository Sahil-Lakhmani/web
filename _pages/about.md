I am a second-year Bachelor's student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). My current interests primarily include [Coding Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory), [Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory_and_organizations) and Algorithm Design. 

I am a part-time Associate Faculty of Mathematics at [Cheenta](https://www.cheenta.com/) where I mentor students for Olympiads in Mathematics and Computer Science some of whom have made it to IMOTC and IOITC, respectively.

Besides academia, I love to follow cricket and basketball. I also like playing chess, solving sudokus and scrolling through [my favourite subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectroBOOM/) in my spare time.
